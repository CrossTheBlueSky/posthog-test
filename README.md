# Testing Posthog Locally

I came across a job listing for Posthog, and wanted to play around with their product before deciding if I wanted to apply. It's pretty interesting and easy to implement, at least as far as I've used it (which has only been for event capturing).

And if you happen to work at Posthog: Hire me please!
